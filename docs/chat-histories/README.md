# Chat Histories

This directory contains detailed records of development conversations and decisions made during the project.

## Purpose

Chat histories serve as:
- **Development documentation** - Record of why decisions were made
- **Knowledge base** - Solutions to problems encountered
- **Onboarding resource** - Help new contributors understand the project evolution
- **Historical context** - Understand the "why" behind the "what"

## How to Add Chat Histories

When working with Claude Code or Claude Desktop on this project:

1. **During the conversation**, ask Claude to save the chat history:
   ```
   "Can you save this conversation to the chat histories?"
   ```

2. **Name the file** with the format:
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md
   ```

3. **Include in the chat history**:
   - Date and topic
   - Summary of what was accomplished
   - Key decisions made
   - Technical details
   - Code changes
   - Lessons learned
   - Next steps
